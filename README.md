## 📝 About  
This project was built as a **portfolio showcase** and the official **website for the ByteBattles cultural hackathon**.  
It’s a fully **hand-coded website** crafted with ❤️ using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no shortcuts.  

🔹 Highlights:  
- 🎭 Designer-style event website  
- 📱 Fully responsive across devices  
- ⚡ Lightweight (<5MB) & fast  
- 🖌️ Custom UI & animations  
- 🗂️ Clean file structure  

I wanted the website to **stand out**, look modern, and also serve as a **template for future events** 🚀

## 🛠️ Future Improvements  
Here are some things I’d like to add or refine:  

- 🖼️ Event posters/gallery section  
- 📝 Dedicated registration form with validations  
- 📱 More tweaks for ultra-small mobile screens  
- 🎨 Smoother nav-bar animations (open/close transitions)  
- 🏆 Add prize, fee & category info to event pages  
- ⏳ Better preloader/loading animation  
- 🌍 Deploy on a custom domain for a professional look
